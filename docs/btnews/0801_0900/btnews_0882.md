有朋自遠方來。

2025年春節剛剛結束，一位新朋友走進馬前卒工作室。
他在經濟艙和橫大樓都過了48小時，取著飛行幾萬公里，然後再繞過整個地球到達上海。
除了宇航員，這是地球上離我們最遠的人。

你好，您來之前我已經了解您的一些資料了，但是您可能還不了解我們這個節目，這裡我想先做一點自我介紹。
我和我的這些同事在製作一個網絡新聞評論的視頻節目。
我們在各個平台有300萬的觀看量。
觀看者主要是20到35歲的青年男性。
我們每週三次，播出20分鐘左右的視頻，每期視頻有40萬到70萬的播放量。
在電視和報紙衰落以後，我們在中國算是一個中等水平的媒體，很高興和您能夠在這個節目上交流。

### 烏拉圭足球

中國人對於烏拉圭最重要的一個印象就是您這個國家的足球非常強，所以我第一個話題要和足球相關。
烏拉圭人口只有300多萬，據我了解，目前所有德國世界杯的國家，烏拉圭應該是人口最少的一個。
以您的各個國家的經歷，烏拉圭的足球或者說烏拉圭的社會和其他國家有什麼不同嗎？

First, I want to thank you very much to for this interview.
And mostly because, as you said, your audience is about young people.
You are right when you say about that Uruguay is very well known because it's it's football.
And you know, and one of the thing that is very impressive is how a little country with not more than 3 million and a half people has won four World Championship in football in 1924, 1928, 1930 and 1950.
I think that the the difference is between how important is football in Uruguay and how important is football in other countries.
For example, in China, football is not the main sport.
football is not yet part of the Chinese way of doing and way of feeling.
In Uruguay, football is a feeling.
This is the difference, because in Uruguay, when you are a very little boy or girl, you start playing football in the schools, in your neighborhood.

### 烏拉圭社會與生活

對於中國人來說，烏拉圭算是世界上最遙遠的一個國家。
您是我見過的第一個烏拉圭人，所以接下來我可能會向您問一些關於烏拉圭相關的話題，讓中國人更了解烏拉圭。
按照中國人的居住方式，烏拉圭這麼大一片面積，我們要居住幾千萬甚至是上億的人口，但是烏拉圭只有300多萬人。
您會認為自己生活在一個非常空曠的國家嗎？

Yes, the territory is not little.
Is, I mean, about 200,000 square kilometers.
And the population is not proportional.
This means that Uruguay has a little domestic market.
And this is why Uruguay foreign policy is oriented to export in order to reach a broader market.

For example, China is the most the most important commercial partner of Uruguay.
Uruguay is the main, for example, beef exporter to China.
Uruguay is the first soy bean exporter to China.
And is the first exporter of paper, pulp of paper to China.
China is supporting Uruguayan growth.

烏拉圭一半的人口聚集在首都。
那麼這個在首都生活和在烏拉圭其他的地方生活有什麼不同嗎？

Montevideo at all level is better, I mean education level, I mean social level, is a little bit more than in the rest of the province.
But each province and each the city of Uruguay has a good level of life.
Primary, secondary, up to the university level, people stay in the city and the province where they born, they born.
But after that, if you want to study in university, you have to move to Montevideo.
There are few universities in the province, but the main are in Montevideo.
And also Montevideo, the capital, offer more job opportunities than in the rest of the country.

從經濟上來看，烏拉圭是南美洲最富裕的國家。
您和您周圍的人會感受到這一點嗎？

People feels comfortable because Uruguay is giving to them job opportunities when you talk about education opportunity and when you talk about health care.
Every every Uruguayan people since they born has access to public health absolutely free.
You don't pay one RMB and you have free access to education and to health care.
And believe me, I used to live in Europe many years, in this case in Italy.
And and Italy, at the same France or Spain, the United States, don't don't have at the level of free education and the level of free health care as Uruguay has it.

### 烏拉圭社會矛盾與政策

從我們感受來說，烏拉圭是一個很和諧的國家。
您作為烏拉圭的共產黨人，應該是已經發現這個國家有比較明顯的社會矛盾。
您能否講一講您眼中的烏拉圭有哪些問題？

Uruguay, as he says, has, of course, its contradictions.
Uruguay is rich, but the distribution is not equal.
Is not, is still unfair.
And this is what people, this is why people elected this again, this new government.
And this new government again will be a government where the Communist Party of Uruguay is playing a very important role.
Because it is a left coalition among all socialist party, communist party, progressive parties, that is called Frente Amplio, broad front.
And all are left left wing parties.
And one of the goal of this new government is to solve the contradiction that exist between rich people and less rich people.
The way to doing that is, for example, I will fiscal issues, I mean tax issues.
Uruguay tax the rich people, those farmers and cattle producer and so on, and with that taxes support social policies.

我發現烏拉圭對吸煙管理很嚴厲，但是是可以合法的吸大麻的。
您對這件事怎麼評價？

Yes, you know that a former president of Uruguay that he passed away, he had been for two time president.
the leader of the left party.
His name was Tabare Vazquez, has been very strict against tobacco.
And in Uruguay in the public places, smoke is absolutely forbidden.
After that, Uruguay has been the first South American country that let smoke marijuana freely.
Also this has been decided by other left president called Mr. Jose Mujica.

And you know that the results of that legal marijuana smoking has been contradictory.
Because some people thinks that this is a way to let people freely use if they want to smoke marijuana and marijuana is not dangerous as cocaine, for example.
But also says that those who are in favor to let people smoke marijuana, is is a way to combat the illegal traffic of marijuana.
Because all the this sector that it is very very dangerous about the traffic of drugs, cocaine and so on.
In Uruguay still exist, but is less dangerous because now that marijuana is free, they have no the chance to traffic with marijuana.

那您對現在這個大麻管理政策是支持還是反對？

Yes, yes, I support.
I think that you know that all this kind of decision, they are, I mean, are not beautiful in all the aspects, are not positive in all the aspects.
But when at the end of the day, when you made the balance, I mean, it is the the things that are better are more important than the things that are bad.
The balance, I mean, and I think that the decision to let people freely smoke marijuana has been more benefit than dangerous.
But I personally I don't smoke marijuana.
I smoke tobacco, cigarettes.

我看新聞報導烏拉圭社會總體上很平靜，但是似乎是因為巴西和阿根廷的犯罪影響,也有很多暴力問題。
您作為普通人會感受到這些暴力嗎？

It is absolutely true that violence in Uruguay is is a matter, is a problem.
The same that in Argentina, I mean, the same that in the rest of South America, not only Brazil and Argentina.
And the government is doing, it's not easy, it's not easy to struggle against violence.
But is Uruguay is doing its best and is one also of the priority of the government is to eliminate the violence that exists, of course, exists.
And you know that the violence has many things that stimulate the violence.
One is the poverty.
And this is why, as I told you before, and this new government is one of its priority is to distribute the wealth in a more equal level.

### 嘉賓個人經歷與對中國的看法

我之前看您的資料，提到您是參加過烏拉圭共產黨。
您是怎麼加入黨的？

I joined the Communist Party in 1971.
I was 16 years old and I I I was a student and have an important role, I play important role in the student trade union.
And I felt very attracted by how the Communist Party was doing at an students level.
And then as to become or to to to improve my participation in the student trade union, I decided to become member and the party invite me to become member of the Communist Party.

可不可以在鏡頭前讓觀眾看一下您的共產黨黨證？

This is my first communist card.
This is the date when I became member of the Communist Party, 1971.

Uruguay since 1973 up to 1985 has a dictatorship, a military government.
And to the the the the struggle against the dictatorship, the Communist Party that was illegal, I had been in jail and also I have to left, I had been sent out of my country.

我是承德市平泉人，大家應該聽說過我家鄉的特產杏仁露。
適合冷飲，也適合冬天熱飲，老人孩子都喜歡。
前幾天回承德拍節目，我採購了市面上所有品牌的杏仁露，倒在一樣的杯子裡，在我們編輯部組織了盲測。
結論非常明顯，樂也牌杏仁露最受歡迎，得票遙遙領先。
我請南方的同事解釋一下他們的選擇。
如果你喜歡杏仁香味，樂野的味道是最濃厚的，而且一點異味都沒有，完全沒有用花生或者其他廉價堅果來頂替杏仁，我一喝就知道。
陶老師同學準確描述了樂野杏仁露的優點。
我家鄉平泉是中國最重要的杏仁產地，從緯度來說也出產最優質的杏仁。
樂野工廠就建在十萬五星樹的山下，所以能夠收集最豐富的杏仁原料，每罐的平均用量是53克杏仁。
杏仁露是植物蛋白飲料，和牛奶一樣有濃純的口感，還有蛋白質提供營養。
和牛奶相比，它最大的優點是避免了乳糖不耐受。
對於我這種喝鮮奶影響腸胃的人來說，杏仁露是不錯的早餐備選。
另外，有些人的舌頭比較敏感，喝太濃的牛奶會留些腥味，杏仁露就沒有這個問題，完全是清爽口感，植物香味。
作為平泉土著，我一直想推薦家鄉特產。
可惜平泉過去是農業縣，大多數產品沒有標準化，質量不穩定。
遇到樂野杏仁露之後我發現，這是一種工農業結合的優質產品，而且跟得上時代，提供低糖型號。
如果你也喜歡植物蛋白飲料，歡迎到評論區下單，支持馬督工家鄉的工農業發展。

### 烏拉圭共產黨對國際局勢的看法

除了討論國內話題之外，烏拉圭的共產黨和左翼黨派平時會怎麼看待這個世界，看待國際局勢？

The Uruguayan Communist Party and the left party in Uruguay feels very very involved and very close to the international affairs.
Uruguay support the multilateralism that China is promoting.
Not the unilateralism that United States want for them.
As it happened when the dissolution of the Soviet Union, United States think that they rule the world.
And this is not true.
Because not only China, but other countries have to the right, the right to participate in the world's decisions.
And this is, I mean, and the leader of this way of doing is China.
This is why Uruguay at a general level, but mostly at the left, the left party and mostly by the Communist Party, feels very very close to the policies that international policy that China is developing.

### 嘉賓在聯合國的工作經歷與對中國的觀察

能否介紹一下您後來到聯合國工作的經歷嗎？您是怎樣到聯合國去工作的？

I used to be the Director General of an international organization called Devnet.
Devnet means Development Network.
This organization was the executed agency of the United Nation Development Program, United Nation Development Program.
This organization has been engaged by United Nation to create a network for link the South countries, the global South, and gave these countries to share technological and commercial information.
It has been created before internet.
After that, I used to work like senior consultant of the United Nation.
I had been engaged to develop programs, developing programs in Africa, Africa and South America.

您來過中國幾十次了，您去其他國家有這麼頻繁嗎？

No, so often.
My first time in China had been in 1989, September 1989.
And then I had been tens of times.
One, because I I I am economist and I had been working with important Chinese companies in order to help them to go overseas.
And also I work as consultant of provisional provincial and cities government in China.
This is at a professional level.
I I feel very very close to to China.
In 2010, I live in Shanghai, the whole year.
Because this organization that I told you before, Devnet, has its own pavilion in Shanghai World Expo in 2010.
And this is when my book has been printed in China.

我大多數觀眾的年齡在20歲到35歲之間，所以您第一次來中國的時候，他們還沒出生。
您能不能從您的角度介紹一下您觀察中國這些年有什麼變化？

My first time, as I told you, in China has been in 1989.
Then I had the chance and the honor to meet Mr. Deng Xiaoping.
And also we had been invited to Shanghai.
And the then mayor of Shanghai, that then became Mr. Zhu, that then he became first Minister of China, invite us to visit Shanghai.
And I remember that he describe or told us about which were the plans to develop Shanghai.
And he show us which were the plans to build, for example, now is Pudong.
And believe me, that in that time, what your audience knows as Pudong were rice plants.
Very hard to to achieve this in 10 years.
My second time was in 2000, 11 years later.
And when I took a flight from Rome to Shanghai, and when I land in Shanghai, and I saw what was Pudong, I think I took the wrong flight, because I can't believe that in 11 years, all that the mayor say that he will develop in Shanghai, had been reached, has been done.
Your audience, the young Chinese people, should know what is called the Chinese miracle.
Because, and this is not only my opinion, what China has done in 40 years, no country in the history, in the human history has done.

您剛才提到您第一次來中國就見到了鄧小平。
您對他個人有什麼記憶？

He received us, he host us in the People, in Tiananmen Square, People Palace.
And he smoked a lot.
And he said that I have a nightmare.
How how to give to all the Chinese people the possibility to have two meals a day, a day.
And he say, China will never, never take the same road of reform as the the Soviet Union has walked by that road.
And I feel that he has a very strategic vision about how to solve the problem of China.
About how to give all the people the chance to eat two times a day as the minimum thing that you have to give to those people.
And as I told before, the results, and this is why I think that Mr. Deng Xiaoping is the in the last century, the most relevant statesman.

### 嘉賓關於中國的著作

聽說您已經寫了一本關於中國的書，而且還在寫第二本。
我能夠請您介紹一下您下一本書想表達的內容嗎？
因為我們畢竟絕大多數中國人都沒有體驗過從拉丁美洲或者從南美洲來看中國的感受，我猜有很多觀眾想讀這本書。

Yes, as you say, in 2010, it's been 15 years ago, I wrote my first book about China.
And I call this book China breathes a new era.
And this book has been printed here in China.
Why I title my book China breathes a new era?
Because China has is changing but has already changed the world.
And in my and China breathes a new era for the not only for China, but for the world.
Now, this book that I am already finished to write it, is called, the title is Discovering China.
What means discover?
Is a Latin word, Latin word, that means to move out what is covering.
You understand?
And I think that the the the goal of this book is to move what is covering what people knows about China, to show what is really doing, what is really happening in China.
The first chapter is called the three C to understand China.
The first is civilization.
China is not only a nation state, but also a civilization state.
The second C is confusion.
Because China, Confucius culture, Confucius philosophy, is still alive and takes part of the political and ideological thinking of the Chinese government and Chinese Communist Party.
It is a mix between Marxism and Confucius.
And this hybrid is very important to understand China.
Because for understanding China, you have to understand also Confucius thought.
The third C is communist.
Because people thinks that China is not communist.
Because China has, I mean, a developed market and they say that China is more capitalist than communist.
And this is not true.
China has is rule by the Chinese Communist Party, and the Chinese Communist Party is a Marxism, Leninism and Maoism party.
And all, all the strategy of the Chinese Communist Party, of the Chinese government is sought in order to make its own road for building a socialist country, not a capitalist country.
It is, I mean, the Chinese, the socialism with Chinese characteristic, as Mr. Deng Xiaoping says.
The second chapter is called the reformer and the reform that changed the world.
The reformer was Mr. Deng Xiaoping when Mr. Deng Xiaoping launched what is called the process of reform and opening up.
He changed the world.
And reform in China, the world start making its own change because China.
The third chapter is the democracy with Chinese characteristic.
Because also Western audience, Western thinkers say that China is not a democratic country.
But when they say that China is not democratic, they are thinking in the Western democracy model.
And the Western must understand that there is more than one model of democracy.
More than one, not only one model.
And China has its own model of democracy.
And China, why China is also a democratic country, because the result of Chinese policies has helped the people, serve the people, say Mr. Chairman Mao Zedong.
And the democracy is the government of the people.
And if you are a democratic, a democracy model, when you serve the people, and when the people support you, and Chinese people, it's not a matter of election, but has shown that they support their government.
The fourth chapter is what I call the two shames.
Confucius say that there are two shames.
One is poverty, and the second was the that the the the wealth is not well distributed.
That the the the wealth is concentrate in just a part of the population.
And Chinese reach to solve the two shames.
Because in 2020, Chinese finished with the extreme poverty.
There is no extreme powers in China.
This mean this this shame was cancelled.
And the second shame that is about the distribution of the wealth, China, and mostly after the 20th Congress, start what Mr. Xi Jinping call the common prosperity.
This mean that the prosperity of China must be distributed in a fair way.
That the wealth arrive to all the people.
And that China must become a most prosperous society.
And this is what is happening in China.
And the fifth chapter I call a new dream for a new era.
Because since Mr. Xi Jinping in 2013, five weeks after he has been elected Secretary General, visiting the Beijing, the National Museum of China, Place in Tiananmen Square, he launched his proposal about the Chinese dream of rejuvination of your country.
And this is, I mean, the most important political issue that China now is handling.
Because the Chinese dream means that China will become in 2049, 100 year after the the constitution of the Chinese the the Chinese Popular Republic.
The Chinese dream is to become a prosperous socialist country at technological, technological level, economic level and political level.
And this is why I focus the last chapter about how China is building and its Chinese dream.

### 对中国的批评意见

因為我們很少和南美洲的人打交道，所以我非常想聽到您的批評意見。
就是無論是和烏拉圭還是和其他國家相比，您認為中國有哪些地方您認為是缺點，是需要改造的？

One problem that China has is that still now the government is making very strong efforts, but the health care is not enough.
You have problem with the to spread the social network and give still more access to the social security.
You have problem.
And you have problem in order to give all the Chinese, as Uruguay is given, the chance to have at all the level free education.
You know that one of the problem that young people in China has that is to access to the universities.
The Gaokao, the examination is very hard.
No all the young people have access to the level of education that they have the right to access.
Another problem that China is facing is, and this is about the social contribution, is that your population is aged.
And those that have more than 60, 70 years, that work for more than 40, 50 years, they don't have enough pension contribution that they deserve.
Another problem is the difference between the development of cities like Shanghai or city in the province.
And this is what China is trying to be more fair and support the development, for example, in Xinjiang province, the effort that China is doing or with the West province in order to make a more fair distribution, the wealth between the rich province and the more poor province.
This is a very critical problem for China, because you see that the level of life between the West Chinese that lives in the Western is very different, different that the level of life that you see in the East of China.
One issue is Hangzhou, Wuhan, Shanghai, Shenzhen.
Another issue is the situation that you face in in Tibet, for example.
What is important is that the problem exists, the contradiction exists, but in the other hand, the government knows about this and is taking the measures to solve this contradiction.

對於中國來說，烏拉圭是最低調的國家之一。
距離遠，與世無爭，安靜的向國際市場供應牛肉，只是在世界杯前後才能偶爾成為焦點。
希望今天的節目能夠加強中烏兩國人民的相互了解。
