有朋自远方来。

2025年春节刚刚结束，一位新朋友走进马前卒工作室。
他在经济舱和横大楼都过了48小时，曲折飞行几万公里，然后再绕过整个地球到达上海。
除了宇航员，这是地球上离我们最远的人。

你好，您来之前我已经了解您的一些资料了，但是您可能还不了解我们这个节目，这里我想先做一点自我介绍。

我和我的这些同事在制作一个网络新闻评论的视频节目。我们在各个平台有300万的观看量。观看者主要是20到35岁的青年男性。

我们每周三次，播出20分钟左右的视频，每期视频有40万到70万的播放量。在电视和报纸衰落以后，我们在中国算是一个中等水平的媒体，很高兴和您能够在这个节目上交流。


### 乌拉圭足球

中国人对于乌拉圭最重要的一个印象就是您这个国家的足球非常强，所以我第一个话题要和足球相关。
乌拉圭人口只有300多万，据我了解，目前所有得过世界杯的国家，乌拉圭应该是人口最少的一个。
以您的各个国家的经历，乌拉圭的足球或者说乌拉圭的社会和其他国家有什么不同吗？

First, I want to thank you very much to for this interview.
And mostly because, as you said, your audience is about young people.
You are right when you say about that Uruguay is very well known because it's it's football.
And you know, and one of the thing that is very impressive is how a little country with not more than 3 million and a half people has won four World Championship in football in 1924, 1928, 1930 and 1950.
I think that the the difference is between how important is football in Uruguay and how important is football in other countries.
For example, in China, football is not the main sport.
football is not yet part of the Chinese way of doing and way of feeling.
In Uruguay, football is a feeling.
This is the difference, because in Uruguay, when you are a very little boy or girl, you start playing football in the schools, in your neighborhood.

首先，我非常感谢您本次的采访。主要是因为，如您所说，您的受众是年轻人。

你说得对，乌拉圭因其足球而闻名。一个只有三百五十万人口的小国，在1924年、1928年、1930年和1950年赢得了四次世界杯冠军，令人印象深刻。

我认为区别在于足球在乌拉圭和其他国家重要程度不同。比如在中国，足球不是主流运动，还没能成为中国人生活的一部分。而在乌拉圭，足球是一种氛围，当你还是个小男孩或小女孩时，就会在学校里、在社区里开始踢足球，这就是区别。


### 乌拉圭社会与生活

对于中国人来说，乌拉圭算是世界上最遥远的一个国家。您是我见过的第一个乌拉圭人，所以接下来我可能会向您问一些关于乌拉圭相关的话题，让中国人更了解乌拉圭。

按照中国人的居住方式，乌拉圭这么大一片面积，我们要居住几千万甚至是上亿的人口，但是乌拉圭只有300多万人。

您会认为自己生活在一个非常空旷的国家吗？

Yes, the territory is not little. Is, I mean, about 200,000 square kilometers. And the population is not proportional. This means that Uruguay has a little domestic market. And this is why Uruguay foreign policy is oriented to export in order to reach a broader market.

For example, China is the most the most important commercial partner of Uruguay. Uruguay is the main, for example, beef exporter to China. Uruguay is the first soy bean exporter to China. And is the first exporter of paper, pulp of paper to China. China is supporting Uruguayan growth.

是的，因为乌拉圭国土面积不小，大约有20万平方公里，但那里的人口却不成比例。这意味着乌拉圭国内市场很小。这就是为什么乌拉圭的外交政策是以出口为导向，以期接触到更广阔的市场。比如中国就是乌拉圭最重要的贸易伙伴。

乌拉圭是中国的主要牛肉出口国，第一个向中国出口大豆的国家。也是第一个向中国出口纸浆的国家。中国支持着乌拉圭的增长。


乌拉圭一半的人口聚集在首都。那么在首都生活和在乌拉圭其他的地方生活有什么不同吗？

Montevideo at all level is better, I mean education level, I mean social level, is a little bit more than in the rest of the province.

But each province and each the city of Uruguay has a good level of life.

Primary, secondary, up to the university level, people stay in the city and the province where they born, they born.

But after that, if you want to study in university, you have to move to Montevideo.

There are few universities in the province, but the main are in Montevideo.

And also Montevideo, the capital, offer more job opportunities than in the rest of the country.

蒙得维的亚在各个层面都更好，我指的是教育水平，社会水平，比其他省份要好一些。但乌拉圭的每个省份和每个城市的生活水平都很好。从小学、中学到大学水平，人们出生后就留在他们出生的城市和省份。但之后，如果你想上大学，你就必须搬到蒙得维的亚。省里有一些大学，但大多数都在蒙得维的亚。而且首都蒙得维的亚也提供了比该国其他地区更多的就业机会。

从经济上来看，乌拉圭是南美洲最富裕的国家。您和您周围的人会感受到这一点吗？

People feels comfortable because Uruguay is giving to them job opportunities when you talk about education opportunity and when you talk about health care.

Every every Uruguayan people since they born has access to public health absolutely free. You don't pay one RMB and you have free access to education and to health care.

And believe me, I used to live in Europe many years, in this case in Italy. And and Italy, at the same France or Spain, the United States, don't don't have at the level of free education and the level of free health care as Uruguay has it.

人们感到舒适，因为乌拉圭为他们提供了就业机会。至于教育机会和医疗保健，每一个乌拉圭人自出生起就可以完全免费获得公共医疗服务。你不用付一分钱，就可以免费获得教育和医疗保健。相信我，我曾在欧洲生活多年，比如在意大利，在法国或西班牙、美国一样，在免费教育和免费医疗保健水平上，都比不上乌拉圭。



### 乌拉圭社会矛盾与政策

从我们感受来说，乌拉圭是一个很和谐的国家。您作为乌拉圭的共产党员，应该是已经发现这个国家有比较明显的社会矛盾。您能否讲一讲您眼中的乌拉圭有哪些问题？

Uruguay, as he says, has, of course, its contradictions. Uruguay is rich, but the distribution is not equal. Is not, is still unfair. And this is what people, this is why people elected this again, this new government. And this new government again will be a government where the Communist Party of Uruguay is playing a very important role.

Because it is a left coalition among all socialist party, communist party, progressive parties, that is called Frente Amplio, broad front. And all are left left wing parties. And one of the goal of this new government is to solve the contradiction that exist between rich people and less rich people. The way to doing that is, for example, I will fiscal issues, I mean tax issues. Uruguay tax the rich people, those farmers and cattle producer and so on, and with that taxes support social policies.
乌拉圭当然有社会矛盾。乌拉圭很富有，但分配不平等，仍然不公平。这就是为什么人民再次选举新政府。这个新政府中，乌拉圭共产党将发挥非常重要的作用。因为它是一个由所有社会主义政党、共产党、进步政党组成的左翼政党联盟，叫做广泛阵线（Frente Amplio）。都是左翼政党。

这个新政府的目标之一是解决富人与不那么富裕的人之间存在的矛盾。为此要采取一些财政手段，比如税收手段。乌拉圭对富人征税，那些农民、牧场主等等，并用这些税收支持社会政策。



我发现乌拉圭对吸烟管理很严厉，但是是可以合法的吸大麻的。
您对这件事怎么评价？

Yes, you know that a former president of Uruguay that he passed away, he had been for two time president. the leader of the left party. His name was Tabare Vazquez, has been very strict against tobacco.

And in Uruguay in the public places, smoke is absolutely forbidden. After that, Uruguay has been the first South American country that let smoke marijuana freely. Also this has been decided by other left president called Mr. Jose Mujica.
And you know that the results of that legal marijuana smoking has been contradictory.

Because some people thinks that this is a way to let people freely use if they want to smoke marijuana and marijuana is not dangerous as cocaine, for example. But also says that those who are in favor to let people smoke marijuana, is is a way to combat the illegal traffic of marijuana.
Because all the this sector that it is very very dangerous about the traffic of drugs, cocaine and so on.
In Uruguay still exist, but is less dangerous because now that marijuana is free, they have no the chance to traffic with marijuana.

是的，乌拉圭有一位已故前总统，他曾担任两届总统，是左翼政党的领导人。他的名字是塔瓦雷·巴斯克斯（Tabare Vazquez）。

他严禁烟草，在乌拉圭的公共场所，吸烟是绝对被禁止的。

在那之后，乌拉圭成为南美洲第一个允许自由吸食大麻的国家。这是由另一位左翼总统何塞·穆希卡（Jose Mujica）先生决定的。

但大麻合法化的决定反响不一。

有些人认为尽管大麻不像可卡因那样危险，但这让人可以自由使用大麻。

支持者认为，这是一种打击非法大麻贩运的方式。因为所有涉及毒品、可卡因等非法贩运的这个行业都非常非常危险。这在乌拉圭仍然存在，但危险性降低了，因为现在大麻是自由的，他们就没有机会贩运大麻了。

那您对这个大麻政策如何评价？

Yes, yes, I support. I think that you know that all this kind of decision, they are, I mean, are not beautiful in all the aspects, are not positive in all the aspects.

But when at the end of the day, when you made the balance, I mean, it is the the things that are better are more important than the things that are bad. The balance, I mean, and I think that the decision to let people freely smoke marijuana has been more benefit than dangerous. But I personally I don't smoke marijuana. I smoke tobacco, cigarettes.
我支持。一个政策不可能在各个方面都完美。但最终，当你权衡利弊时，我的意思是，好的方面比坏的方面更重要。

权衡之后，我认为允许人们自由吸食大麻的决定，利大于弊。但我个人不吸食大麻。我吸烟草，香烟。

我看新闻报道乌拉圭社会总体上很平静，但是似乎是因为巴西和阿根廷的犯罪影响,也有很多暴力问题。
您作为普通人会感受到这些暴力吗？
It is absolutely true that violence in Uruguay is is a matter, is a problem.
The same that in Argentina, I mean, the same that in the rest of South America, not only Brazil and Argentina.
And the government is doing, it's not easy, it's not easy to struggle against violence.
But is Uruguay is doing its best and is one also of the priority of the government is to eliminate the violence that exists, of course, exists.
And you know that the violence has many things that stimulate the violence.
One is the poverty.
And this is why, as I told you before, and this new government is one of its priority is to distribute the wealth in a more equal level.

乌拉圭确实存在暴力问题，就像阿根廷以及南美洲其他地区一样，不只是巴西和阿根廷。政府正在努力，与暴力作斗争很不容易。但乌拉圭正在尽其所能，政府的优先事项之一也是消除当然存在的暴力。

暴力有很多助长因素。其中之一就是贫困。这也是为什么我前面提到的，这个新政府的优先事项之一是以更平等的方式进行分配财富。



### 嘉宾个人经历与对中国的看法

我之前看您的资料，提到您是参加过乌拉圭共产党。
您是怎么加入党的？


I joined the Communist Party in 1971.
I was 16 years old and I I I was a student and have an important role, I play important role in the student trade union.
And I felt very attracted by how the Communist Party was doing at an students level.
And then as to become or to to to improve my participation in the student trade union, I decided to become member and the party invite me to become member of the Communist Party.

  我1971年加入共产党。那时我16岁，我是一名学生，并在学生工会中扮演重要角色。我被共产党在学生层面的工作方式深深吸引。然后为了提高我在学生工会中的参与度，我决定成为党员，党也邀请我成为共产党党员。

可不可以在镜头前让观众看一下您的共产党党证？

This is my first communist card.
This is the date when I became member of the Communist Party, 1971.

Uruguay since 1973 up to 1985 has a dictatorship, a military government.
And to the the the the struggle against the dictatorship, the Communist Party that was illegal, I had been in jail and also I have to left, I had been sent out of my country.

Uruguay since 1973 up to 1985 has a dictatorship, a military government.
And to the the the the struggle against the dictatorship, the Communist Party that was illegal, I had been in jail and also I have to left, I had been sent out of my country.

这是我的第一张共产党员证。 这是我成为共产党党员的日期，1971年。1973年到1985年，乌拉圭一直处于军政府独裁统治下，而在反对独裁统治的斗争中，乌拉圭共产党被当作非法组织，我曾被关进监狱，也曾被驱逐出我的祖国。



### 乌拉圭共产党对国际局势的看法

除了讨论国内话题之外，乌拉圭的共产党和左翼党派平时会怎么看待这个世界，看待国际局势？

The Uruguayan Communist Party and the left party in Uruguay feels very very involved and very close to the international affairs.
Uruguay support the multilateralism that China is promoting.
Not the unilateralism that United States want for them.
As it happened when the dissolution of the Soviet Union, United States think that they rule the world.
And this is not true.
Because not only China, but other countries have to the right, the right to participate in the world's decisions.
And this is, I mean, and the leader of this way of doing is China.
This is why Uruguay at a general level, but mostly at the left, the left party and mostly by the Communist Party, feels very very close to the policies that international policy that China is developing.
乌拉圭共产党和乌拉圭的左翼政党对国际事务的参与度非常高，联系非常密切。乌拉圭支持中国正在推动的多边主义。而不是美国想要的单边主义。就像苏联解体时发生的那样，美国认为他们统治世界。这不是事实。因为不仅是中国，其他国家也有权利，有权利参与世界的决策。而我的意思是，中国领导了多边主义的发展。这就是为什么乌拉圭在总体层面，主要是左翼政党和共产党，对中国正在制定的国际政策感到非常亲近。

### 嘉宾在联合国的工作经历与对中国的观察

能否介绍一下您后来到联合国工作的经历吗？您是怎样到联合国去工作的？


I used to be the Director General of an international organization called Devnet.
Devnet means Development Network.
This organization was the executed agency of the United Nation Development Program, United Nation Development Program.
This organization has been engaged by United Nation to create a network for link the South countries, the global South, and gave these countries to share technological and commercial information.
It has been created before internet.
After that, I used to work like senior consultant of the United Nation.
I had been engaged to develop programs, developing programs in Africa, Africa and South America.

我曾经是一家名为Devnet的国际组织的总干事。Devnet的意思是发展网络。这个组织是联合国开发计划署的执行机构。这个组织受联合国委托，建立一个连接全球南方国家的网络，并让这些国家分享技术和商业信息。它是在互联网出现之前创建的。之后在联合国过担任高级顾问。参与在非洲、非洲和南美洲的项目。

您来过中国几十次了，您去其他国家有这么频繁吗？

No, so often.
My first time in China had been in 1989, September 1989.
And then I had been tens of times.
One, because I I I am economist and I had been working with important Chinese companies in order to help them to go overseas.
And also I work as consultant of provisional provincial and cities government in China.
This is at a professional level.
I I feel very very close to to China.
In 2010, I live in Shanghai, the whole year.
Because this organization that I told you before, Devnet, has its own pavilion in Shanghai World Expo in 2010.
And this is when my book has been printed in China.

不，没那么频繁。我第一次来中国是1989年，1989年9月。
总共来了几十次。一是因为我是一名经济学家，我曾与重要的中国公司合作，帮助他们走向海外。我也在中国担任省市政府的顾问。这是在专业层面。我感到与中国非常非常亲近。2010年，我在上海住了一整年。因为我之前告诉您的那个组织，Devnet，在2010年上海世博会上有自己的展馆。我的书也是这时候就在中国出版的。

我大多数观众的年龄在20岁到35岁之间，所以您第一次来中国的时候，他们还没出生。您能不能从您的角度介绍一下您观察中国这些年有什么变化？

My first time, as I told you, in China has been in 1989.
Then I had the chance and the honor to meet Mr. Deng Xiaoping.
And also we had been invited to Shanghai.
And the then mayor of Shanghai, that then became Mr. Zhu, that then he became first Minister of China, invite us to visit Shanghai.
And I remember that he describe or told us about which were the plans to develop Shanghai.
And he show us which were the plans to build, for example, now is Pudong.
And believe me, that in that time, what your audience knows as Pudong were rice plants.
Very hard to to achieve this in 10 years.
My second time was in 2000, 11 years later.
And when I took a flight from Rome to Shanghai, and when I land in Shanghai, and I saw what was Pudong, I think I took the wrong flight, because I can't believe that in 11 years, all that the mayor say that he will develop in Shanghai, had been reached, has been done.
Your audience, the young Chinese people, should know what is called the Chinese miracle.
Because, and this is not only my opinion, what China has done in 40 years, no country in the history, in the human history has done.

我第一次来中国是1989年，然后我有幸见到了邓小平先生。我们还被邀请去了上海。当时的上海市长朱镕基先生，也是后来的中国总理，邀请我们访问上海。

我记得他告诉我们开发上海的建设计划，比如，现在的浦东在那时还是一片稻田。很难想象在10年内实现这个规划。

我第二次来是在2000年，11年后。当我从罗马飞往上海，当我降落在上海，当我看到浦东的样子，我想我坐错了飞机，因为我无法相信在11年里，市长说他将在上海开发的一切都已经完成。

你的观众，中国的年轻人，应该知道什么是中国奇迹。因为，这不仅是我的看法，中国在40年里所做的事情，人类历史上没有任何国家做到过。

您刚才提到您第一次来中国就见到了邓小平。
您对他个人有什么记忆？

He received us, he host us in the People, in Tiananmen Square, People Palace.
And he smoked a lot.
And he said that I have a nightmare.
How how to give to all the Chinese people the possibility to have two meals a day, a day.
And he say, China will never, never take the same road of reform as the the Soviet Union has walked by that road.
And I feel that he has a very strategic vision about how to solve the problem of China.
About how to give all the people the chance to eat two times a day as the minimum thing that you have to give to those people.
And as I told before, the results, and this is why I think that Mr. Deng Xiaoping is the in the last century, the most relevant statesman.

他在人民大会堂接待了我们。他抽了很多烟，说他有一个噩梦。那就是如何让所有中国人每天都能吃上两顿饭。

他说中国永远不会走苏联走过的改革道路。我觉得他对如何解决中国的问题有着非常战略性的眼光。知道如何给所有人民每天吃两次饭的机会，这是必须给予人们最低限度的东西。正如我之前所说，结果表明，这就是为什么我认为邓小平先生是上世纪最杰出的政治家。

### 嘉宾关于中国的著作

听说您已经写了一本关于中国的书，而且还在写第二本。
我能够请您介绍一下您下一本书想表达的内容吗？
因为我们毕竟绝大多数中国人都没体验过从拉丁美洲或者从南美洲来看中国的感受，我猜有很多观众想读这本书。


Yes, as you say, in 2010, it's been 15 years ago, I wrote my first book about China.
And I call this book China breathes a new era.
And this book has been printed here in China.

是的，如你所说，2010年，也就是15年前，我写了我的第一本关于中国的书。我把这本书命名为《中国孕育新时代》。这本书在中国出版了。


Why I title my book China breathes a new era?
Because China has is changing but has already changed the world.
And in my and China breathes a new era for the not only for China, but for the world.
Now, this book that I am already finished to write it, is called, the title is Discovering China.


**为什么我将这本书命名为《中国孕育新时代》？**

因为中国正在改变，而且已经改变了世界。而且在我看来，中国正在为不仅是中国，也为世界孕育新时代。现在，我已经写完的这本书，书名叫《发现中国》。

What means discover?
Is a Latin word, Latin word, that means to move out what is covering.
You understand?
And I think that the the the goal of this book is to move what is covering what people knows about China, to show what is really doing, what is really happening in China.

**发现是什么意思？**
它是一个拉丁词，意思是移开遮盖的东西。你明白吗？我认为这本书的目标是移开人们对中国的了解上的遮盖物，展示中国正在做什么，中国正在发生什么。

The first chapter is called the three C to understand China.
The first is civilization.
China is not only a nation state, but also a civilization state.
The second C is confusion.
Because China, Confucius culture, Confucius philosophy, is still alive and takes part of the political and ideological thinking of the Chinese government and Chinese Communist Party.
It is a mix between Marxism and Confucius.
And this hybrid is very important to understand China.
Because for understanding China, you have to understand also Confucius thought.
The third C is communist.
Because people thinks that China is not communist.
Because China has, I mean, a developed market and they say that China is more capitalist than communist.
And this is not true.
China has is rule by the Chinese Communist Party, and the Chinese Communist Party is a Marxism, Leninism and Maoism party.
And all, all the strategy of the Chinese Communist Party, of the Chinese government is sought in order to make its own road for building a socialist country, not a capitalist country.
It is, I mean, the Chinese, the socialism with Chinese characteristic, as Mr. Deng Xiaoping says.


第一章叫做理解中国的三个C。第一个C是文明（Civilization）。中国不仅是一个民族国家，也是一个文明国家。第二个C是孔子（Confucius）。因为中国，孔子文化，孔子哲学，仍然活跃着，并成为中国政府和中国共产党政治和思想体系的一部分。它是马克思主义和孔子的结合。这种混合体对于理解中国非常重要。因为要理解中国，你也必须理解孔子的思想。第三个C是共产主义（Communist）。因为人们认为中国不是共产主义国家。因为中国有一个发达的市场，他们说中国与其说是共产主义，不如说是资本主义。
这不是事实。中国是由中国共产党统治的，中国共产党是一个马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的政党。中国共产党，中国政府的所有战略，都是为了走出自己的道路，建设一个社会主义国家，而不是资本主义国家。我的意思是，正如邓小平先生所说，具有中国特色的社会主义。


The second chapter is called the reformer and the reform that changed the world.
The reformer was Mr. Deng Xiaoping when Mr. Deng Xiaoping launched what is called the process of reform and opening up.
He changed the world.
And reform in China, the world start making its own change because China.
The third chapter is the democracy with Chinese characteristic.

**第二章叫做改革家和改变世界的改革。**
改革家是邓小平先生，当时邓小平先生启动了所谓的改革开放进程。他改变了世界。随着中国的改革，世界因为中国开始了自己的改变。

Because also Western audience, Western thinkers say that China is not a democratic country.
But when they say that China is not democratic, they are thinking in the Western democracy model.
And the Western must understand that there is more than one model of democracy.
More than one, not only one model.
And China has its own model of democracy.
And China, why China is also a democratic country, because the result of Chinese policies has helped the people, serve the people, say Mr. Chairman Mao Zedong.
And the democracy is the government of the people.
And if you are a democratic, a democracy model, when you serve the people, and when the people support you, and Chinese people, it's not a matter of election, but has shown that they support their government.

**第三章是具有中国特色的民主**。
因为西方受众，西方思想家也说中国不是一个民主国家。但当他们说中国不民主时，他们是在想着西方的民主模式。而西方必须明白，民主模式不止一种。不止一种，不只有一种模式。中国有自己的民主模式。 而中国，为什么中国也是一个民主国家，因为中国政策的结果帮助了人民，服务了人民，毛泽东主席先生说。民主是民有政府。如果你是一个民主的，一个民主模式，当你服务人民，当人民支持你，而且中国人民，这不是选举的问题，而是已经表明他们支持他们的政府。

The fourth chapter is what I call the two shames.
Confucius say that there are two shames.
One is poverty, and the second was the that the the the wealth is not well distributed.
That the the the wealth is concentrate in just a part of the population.
And Chinese reach to solve the two shames.
Because in 2020, Chinese finished with the extreme poverty.
There is no extreme powers in China.
This mean this this shame was cancelled.
And the second shame that is about the distribution of the wealth, China, and mostly after the 20th Congress, start what Mr. Xi Jinping call the common prosperity.
This mean that the prosperity of China must be distributed in a fair way.
That the wealth arrive to all the people.
And that China must become a most prosperous society.
And this is what is happening in China.

**第四章我称之为两个耻辱。**
孔子说有两个耻辱。一个是贫困，第二个是财富没有得到很好的分配。财富仅仅集中在一部分人口手中。而中国解决了这两个耻辱。因为在2020年，中国彻底消灭了绝对贫困。中国没有绝对贫困。这意味着这个耻辱被消除了。
而第二个关于财富分配的耻辱，中国，尤其是在二十大之后，开始实施习近平先生所说的共同富裕。这意味着中国的繁荣必须公平分配。财富要惠及所有人。而且中国必须成为一个最繁荣的社会。这就是中国正在发生的事情。
And the fifth chapter I call a new dream for a new era.
Because since Mr. Xi Jinping in 2013, five weeks after he has been elected Secretary General, visiting the Beijing, the National Museum of China, Place in Tiananmen Square, he launched his proposal about the Chinese dream of rejuvination of your country.
And this is, I mean, the most important political issue that China now is handling.
Because the Chinese dream means that China will become in 2049, 100 year after the the constitution of the Chinese the the Chinese Popular Republic.
The Chinese dream is to become a prosperous socialist country at technological, technological level, economic level and political level.
And this is why I focus the last chapter about how China is building and its Chinese dream.


**第五章我称之为新时代的新梦想**

因为自2013年习近平先生当选总书记五周后，访问北京，中国国家博物馆，天安门广场，他提出了关于实现中华民族伟大复兴中国梦的倡议。

我的意思是，这是中国目前正在处理的最重要的政治议题。
因为中国梦意味着到2049年，中华人民共和国成立100周年时，中国将在技术层面、经济层面和政治层面成为一个繁荣的社会主义国家。

这就是为什么我最后一章聚焦于中国如何建设其中国梦。


### 对中国的批评意见

因为我们很少和南美洲的人打交道，所以我非常想听到您的批评意见。
就是无论是和乌拉圭还是和其他国家相比，您认为中国有哪些地方您认为是缺点，是需要改造的？


One problem that China has is that still now the government is making very strong efforts, but the health care is not enough.
You have problem with the to spread the social network and give still more access to the social security. You have problem.

中国存在的一个问题是，尽管政府现在正在做出非常大的努力，但医疗保健仍然不足。在普及社会网络和提供更多社会保障方面有问题。

And you have problem in order to give all the Chinese, as Uruguay is given, the chance to have at all the level free education.
You know that one of the problem that young people in China has that is to access to the universities.
The Gaokao, the examination is very hard.
No all the young people have access to the level of education that they have the right to access.

而且在为所有中国人，像乌拉圭那样，提供各级免费教育的机会方面有问题。
中国年轻人面临的一个问题是上大学难。高考，这个考试非常难。不是所有年轻人都能获得他们有权获得的教育水平。
Another problem that China is facing is, and this is about the social contribution, is that your population is aged.
And those that have more than 60, 70 years, that work for more than 40, 50 years, they don't have enough pension contribution that they deserve.

中国面临的另一个问题是，这是关于社会贡献，就是你们的人口正在老龄化。

那些60、70多岁，工作了40、50年以上的人，他们没有获得应得的足够养老金。

Another problem is the difference between the development of cities like Shanghai or city in the province.

And this is what China is trying to be more fair and support the development, for example, in Xinjiang province, the effort that China is doing or with the West province in order to make a more fair distribution, the wealth between the rich province and the more poor province.

另一个问题是像上海这样的城市与省内其他城市发展之间的差距。

中国正在努力实现更公平的发展，比如支援新疆，中国目前在西部所做，目的是在发达省份和欠发达省份之间的财富分配。


This is a very critical problem for China, because you see that the level of life between the West Chinese that lives in the Western is very different, different that the level of life that you see in the East of China.

这对中国来说是一个非常关键的问题，因为你会发现中国西部人民的生活水平与在中国东部看到的生活水平非常不同。

One issue is Hangzhou, GuangZhou, Shanghai, Shenzhen.

Another issue is the situation that you face in in Tibet, for example.
What is important is that the problem exists, the contradiction exists, but in the other hand, the government knows about this and is taking the measures to solve this contradiction.

一边是杭州、广州、上海、深圳，另外一边比如。重要的西藏这样的地区。问题存在，矛盾存在，但另一方面，政府知道这一点，并正在着力于解决这些矛盾。


对于中国来说，乌拉圭是最低调的国家之一。
距离远，与世无争，安静的向国际市场供应牛肉，只是在世界杯前后才能偶尔成为焦点。
希望今天的节目能够加强中乌两国人民的相互了解。
